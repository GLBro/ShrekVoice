# Shrek Chat Box

From Untangled 2019.

## Installation

1. Clone the git repository.
2. Install `python` (minimum version `3.7`).
3. Use `pip` to install `playsound`, `SpeechRecognition`, `pyttsx3`
   **NOTE**: `SpeechRecognition` requires `PyAudio`. We had problems installing this on Windows 10 with Python 3.7, so manually installing [the pre-compiled package](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio) will bypass this.
4. Run `shrekmenu.py`.goit
